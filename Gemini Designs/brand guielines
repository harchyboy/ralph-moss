Hartz AI: Brand Identity & Style Guidelines

Version 1.0 | The Digital Lab Aesthetic

1. Brand Essence

Hartz AI is a bridge between the complex frontier of Artificial Intelligence and the practical needs of UK SMEs. Our brand is Digital-first, Science-inspired, and Human-centered.

Core Promise: Clarity over Hype.

Mission: Empowering organizations through confidence, clarity, and capability.

Aesthetic Goal: To look like a high-end research institution (e.g., DeepMind) while remaining accessible and grounded.

2. Voice & Tone

We speak as a Trusted Writing Coach or Senior Editor. We are authoritative but never arrogant; technical but never jargon-heavy.

Do: Use plain English, be direct, use active verbs, and focus on practical outcomes.

Don't: Use "AI buzzwords" (synergy, disrupt, paradigm shift), be overly abstract, or use fear-based marketing.

3. Visual Identity

3.1 Logo Usage

The Hartz AI logo consists of the wordmark HARTZ in Inter Bold followed by a blue-bordered circle containing the letters AI.

Clear Space: Maintain a "safe zone" around the logo equal to the width of the 'H' in Hartz.

Minimum Size: 24px height for digital displays.

Backgrounds: Primarily used on Pure White (#FFFFFF). On dark backgrounds, use a white wordmark with the blue circle preserved.

3.2 Color Palette

The palette is intentionally limited to create a "Technical Blueprint" feel.

Color

Hex

Usage

Hartz White

#FFFFFF

Primary background, expansive whitespace.

Hartz Black

#0A0A0A

Primary text, navigation, and high-impact UI.

Hartz Blue

#4A90E2

The "Bioluminescent" accent, CTAs, and glows.

Hartz Muted

#666666

Secondary text and meta-data labels.

Hartz Border

rgba(0,0,0,0.08)

Technical hairlines and grid dividers.

4. Typography

The brand exclusively uses Inter to maintain a clean, high-tech engineering feel.

Primary Headline: Inter ExtraBold or Black.

Tracking: -0.05em (Tightly packed for a "blocky" impact).

Leading: 0.9 to 1.1.

Sub-headlines: Inter Bold.

Tracking: -0.02em.

Body Text: Inter Medium or Regular.

Leading: 1.6 (Generous line-height for readability).

Meta/Labels: Inter Bold, All-Caps.

Tracking: 0.3em (Spaced out for a scientific label feel).

5. Layout & Components

5.1 The Bento Grid

Content should be grouped in modular "Bento" cards to signify organization and clarity.

Radius: 32px to 40px for a soft, modern feel.

Borders: 1px solid Hartz Border.

Shadows: Very subtle or non-existent. Prefer border-color changes on hover (Hartz Blue).

5.2 Technical Hairlines

Use thin lines (0.5px - 1px) to divide sections. This mimics architectural blueprints and scientific papers.

5.3 Bioluminescent Atmosphere

The "Glow" is our signature visual. Use large, low-opacity radial gradients of Hartz Blue (approx. 2% to 5% opacity). It should feel like a faint light reflecting off a lens, not a solid color.

6. Imagery & Graphics

6.1 Abstract Visuals

Avoid generic AI stock photography. Instead, use:

Generative Geometry: Vector line art of nodes, paths, and grids.

Atmospheric Orbs: Soft, blurred blue gradients.

Grain: A 3% opacity noise overlay on the entire site to add "cinematic" texture to the white background.

6.2 Photography (E-E-A-T)

When using real photography (Founders, Teams, Offices):

Style: Clean, minimalist, natural lighting.

Treatment: Use a slight grayscale filter or high-key lighting to integrate with the white aesthetic.

7. Semantic SEO Principles

Design decisions must reinforce the page's "Entity":

Every image must have a descriptive alt tag (e.g., "Hartz AI Roadmap showing 4-phase SME training model").

Use standard HTML hierarchy (<h1> through <h5>) for search engine categorization.

Incorporate JSON-LD Schema for courses and services directly into the code.
