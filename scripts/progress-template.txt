# Progress Template for Ralph Moss PRDs
# =====================================
# Copy this template to your PRD folder as progress.txt
# Each iteration appends to this file - NEVER delete content

# ============================================================
# CODEBASE PATTERNS (Add patterns discovered during execution)
# ============================================================
# These patterns carry forward to ALL future iterations

## Database Schema Patterns
- contact_type column (NOT 'type') - stores contact role
- account_id (NOT 'company_id') - foreign key to accounts table
- accounts table (NOT 'companies') - stores company data

## API Patterns
- Use fetchWithAuth from @/lib/api for authenticated requests
- API endpoints follow pattern: api/[resource].ts
- Query params passed as object to useQuery hooks

## Component Patterns
- FilterDropdown expects options: Array<{value: string, label: string}>
- InlineEditField handles blur/enter save automatically
- Use Badge component for status indicators

## Testing Patterns
- Mock useQuery hooks with vi.mock('@tanstack/react-query')
- Use renderWithProviders for components needing context
- E2E tests use data-testid attributes for selectors

# ============================================================
# KEY LEARNINGS (Add critical discoveries here)
# ============================================================
# These prevent repeated mistakes

## What Works
- [Add successful approaches here]

## What Doesn't Work
- [Add failed approaches and why they failed]

## Gotchas Discovered
- [Add unexpected behaviors or requirements]

# ITERATION LOG (Append each iteration below)
